# typyspeed
A very simple script to track your typing speed throughout the day. 

## Usage:
Make sure to install the necessarry modules (they are not in the `requirements.txt` because I have been too lazy to add them.)
Simply run the code and the results will be printed in the console. Your average is continuously updated and added to a text file.
To stop the program simply go to the console window and press `ctrl + c` (keyboard interrupt) 

## NOTICE: 
I am aware that in vscode pylint says a variable isn't declared. The variable is declared and should not be an issue
